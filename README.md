# CribbageCounter

This program will take in a five-card cribbage hand and return the amount of points earned by scoring flushes, 15s, runs and pairs.

My goal for this repo is to show my progress from first draft to second draft and so on. My first draft was completed using functions and many list iterations. After some feedback, I wanted to redo the program and use more OOP to make the code more efficent.
